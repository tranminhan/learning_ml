They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. I can\\'t believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess. Look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, the widows, Windy Poplars . . . and Anne\\'s college years, for heaven\\'s sake!!! Wouldn\\'t it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! But L.M. Montgomery\\'s beautiful work is something that should not be denied. This movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough Anne of Green Gables to life.\"'],\n",
